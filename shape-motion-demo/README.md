# Project 3: LCD Game

## Description

My game is about not letting the ball go to the bottom of the screen. The user moves the bar at the position at where the ball will fall, when the ball touches the bar it will give the user a point, if the ball touches the bottom part, the score will go down.
Every time the ball touches the bar it will make a sound indicating the collision.
To move the bar the user presses the Switch 1, the bar will go to the right and go back.
When the user gets a score of 5 the screen will show a message that the user won, and it will play a sound.
